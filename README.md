A simplified Elixir string-based XML processor that avoids the atom exhaustion vulnerability present with xmerl based parsers.  It does so by using the `SimpleForm` DOM reprsentation generated by [saxy](https://hex.pm/packages/saxy) library.  Unlike `:xmerl`, this representation only uses strings for all details about the XML document.

This library adds some basic operations for traversing the XML document and obtaining attributes and text values.

## Installation

The package can be installed, via [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/simple_xml), by adding `simple_xml` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:simple_xml, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Parsing

Parsing is as straightforward as invoking the following command:

```elixir
> SimpleXml.parse(~S{<foo a="1">bar</foo>})
{:ok, {"foo", [{"a", "1"}], ["bar"]}}
```

See `SimpleXml.parse/1` for details.

## Digest and Signature Verification

XML digests and signatures can be verified via the following function.

```elixir
> SimpleXml.verify(root, public_key)
```

We leave it up to the caller to provide the public key against which verify the signature.  Please see `SimpleXml.verify/2` documentation for detailed examples.
